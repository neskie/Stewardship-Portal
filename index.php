			<h1 class="pageName"> Stewardship Portal </h1>
 				<p class="bodyText"> The Stewardship Department of Tsilhqot'in National Government 
   				is developing an interactive land and resource &quot;Stewardship Planning 
   				Portal.&quot; The Stewardship Portal is a web-based, land-use information 
					management and planning support system. <br />
 				</p>
 				<p class="bodyText">One of the Stewardship Portal's primary functions is to 
  					improve the efficiency and quality of the referral process. Many of the 
   				tedious steps of the referral process like filing, tracking, and the dependence 
			      on the TNG office are simplified through the automated functions of our 
			      spatial database, which is accessible online and therefore accessible in 
			      any community with internet access. This database stores any type of land 
			      and resource information from reports to photos to proposed cut block locations 
			      in relation to the area of land for which they are relevant. <br />
		    </p>
		    <p class="bodyText">The Portal makes the power of Geographic Information Systems 
		      (GIS) accessible by being cost-effective and user-friendly for remote communities, 
		      and therefore minimizes paper handling time. The Portal is a significant 
		      step toward empowering First Nations communities to be directly involved 
		      in land and resource stewardship. <br />
